## Why Isaac?

**Built for real homesteaders.** Not a corporate farm platform. Not a spreadsheet. Isaac was built by a homesteader, for homesteaders — people who need to track when the goats need worming, whether the tomatoes will survive tonight's frost, and how much they spent on hay this month.

**Runs on a Raspberry Pi.** Your data stays on your property. No cloud subscriptions, no monthly fees, no one mining your farm data. Just a $50 computer on your kitchen counter.

**Works offline.** Isaac runs entirely on your local network. Weather data caches, tasks are stored locally, and everything works even if your internet goes down. Installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on any device.

**Access from anywhere.** When you do want remote access, set up Tailscale (free VPN) or Cloudflare Tunnel in minutes. Check on the farm from your phone while you're at the feed store.

**Touch-friendly.** Designed for a Pi with a touchscreen on the barn wall, a tablet in the kitchen, or your phone in the field. Big buttons, clean interface, on-screen keyboard — works with dirty hands.

**Syncs with your phone.** CalDAV integration means Isaac's tasks and events show up in your iPhone or Android calendar. No extra app needed.

**Automates the boring stuff.** Isaac generates reminders from your plant care schedules, animal care schedules, vehicle maintenance intervals, and more. It watches the weather and alerts you before frost hits. It skips outdoor watering tasks when it rains.

**Speaks your workers' language.** Multi-language support (English/Spanish) with automatic translation for worker task instructions.

---

## Quick Start

**Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4/5 (4GB+ RAM) or any Linux server

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/n0mad1k/isaac.git /opt/isaac
cd /opt/isaac

# Backend
cd backend && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt && deactivate

# Frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run build

# Start
sudo systemctl start isaac-backend nginx
```

Open `https://your-pi-ip` and the setup wizard walks you through creating your admin account and configuring your homestead.

See the **[full installation guide](https://github.com/n0mad1k/isaac/wiki/Installation)** for the complete step-by-step setup including SSL, Nginx, CalDAV, and kiosk mode.

## Remote Access

| Method | Best For | Setup Time |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **[Tailscale](https://github.com/n0mad1k/isaac/wiki/Remote-Access#tailscale-vpn)** | Personal/family access from anywhere | 5 minutes |
| **[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://github.com/n0mad1k/isaac/wiki/Remote-Access#cloudflare-tunnel)** | Public access via custom domain | 15 minutes |
